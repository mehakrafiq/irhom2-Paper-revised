abstract = {Dysregulation of the disintegrin-metalloproteinase ADAM10 may contribute to the development of diseases including tumorigenesis and Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms underlying ADAM10 sheddase activation are incompletely understood. Here, we show that transient exposure of the negatively charged phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) is necessarily required. The soluble PS headgroup was found to act as competitive inhibitor of substrate cleavage. Overexpression of the Ca2+-dependent phospholipid scramblase Anoctamin-6 (ANO6) led to increased PS externalization and substrate release. Transfection with a constitutively active form of ANO6 resulted in maximum sheddase activity in the absence of any stimulus. Calcium-dependent ADAM10 activation could not be induced in lymphocytes of patients with Scott syndrome harbouring a missense mutation in ANO6. A putative PS-binding motif was identified in the conserved stalk region. Replacement of this motif resulted in strong reduction of sheddase activity. In conjunction with the recently described 3D structure of the ADAM10 extracellular domain, a model is advanced to explain how surface-exposed PS triggers ADAM10 sheddase function.},

abstract = {Phosphotyrosine peptide binding to Grb2 induces tryptophan fluorescence changes in the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. Affinities are in the nanomolar range, the Shc peptide having the highest affinity, followed by peptides mimicking Grb2 binding sites on EGF and HGF receptors, the putative sites on insulin and IGF-1 receptors having much lower affinities. Proline-rich peptide binding to the SH3 domains induces fluorescence changes mainly in the C-terminal SH3. Affinities are in the micromolar range, the highest affinity peptides mimicking the first proline-rich motif of the Sos C-terminus. Additional residues before this PVPPPVPP motif provide a minor contribution to the binding, but the two residues after this motif are important and may contribute to specificity. The affinity of each SH3 for each proline-rich motif is too low to account for the high stability of the Grb2-Sos complex, suggesting that Grb2 recognizes other structural features in the Sos C-terminus. Binding of a phosphotyrosine peptide to the SH2 has no effect on the SH3s. Thus the binding of Grb2 to a receptor or to an associated protein phosphorylated on tyrosines is unlikely to activate the exchange factor activity of Sos through a conformational change transmitted from the SH2 to the SH3 domains.},

abstract = {The nuclear factor (NF)-$\kappa$B family of transcriptional factors plays a critical role in inflammation, immunoregulation, cell differentiation, and tumorigenesis. This study aims to investigate the role of methylation of genes encoding for the NF-$\kappa$B family in breast cancer. We analyze the DNA methylation status of the NFKB1 gene and the RELA gene in breast cancer using pyrosequencing. The expression of NF-$\kappa$B1 and RELA proteins is assessed and the level of RNA transcripts in frozen tissue is determined using RT-PCR. There is no statistically significant difference in the methylation status of the NFKB1 and the RELA genes between tumors and normal tissues. The methylation status of the NFKB1 gene and the RELA gene is not significantly associated with the levels of NF-$\kappa$B1 transcripts in tumor tissues. However, the methylation level of the RELA gene is significantly associated with the level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$. In addition, the level of NF-$\kappa$B1 transcripts was associated with the levels of TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-4. In tumors with positive TNF-$\alpha$, the increased methylation level of the RELA gene is significantly associated with the positive expression of NF-$\kappa$B1 transcripts. These results demonstrate that the level of the RELA gene methylation is related to the levels of NF-$\kappa$B1 transcripts under the influence of TNF-$\alpha$. Further study is needed to determine how TNF-$\alpha$ is involved in the methylation of the RELA gene and the subsequent expression of NF-$\kappa$B1.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate the majority of cellular responses to external stimuli. Upon activation by a ligand, the receptor binds to a partner heterotrimeric G protein and promotes exchange of GTP for GDP, leading to dissociation of the G protein into $\alpha$ and $\beta$,$\gamma$ subunits that mediate downstream signals. GPCRs can also activate distinct signaling pathways through arrestins. Active states of GPCRs form by small rearrangements of the ligand-binding, or orthosteric, site that are amplified into larger conformational changes. Molecular understanding of the allosteric coupling between ligand binding and G protein or arrestin interaction is emerging from structures of several GPCRs crystallized in inactive and active states, spectroscopic data, and computer simulations. The coupling is loose, rather than concerted, and agonist binding does not fully stabilize the receptor in an active conformation. Distinct intermediates whose populations are shifted by ligands of different efficacies underlie the complex pharmacology of GPCRs.},

Activated GPCRs dissociate G$\alpha$GDP$\beta$$\gamma$ heterotrimer into G$\alpha$GTP and free G$\beta$$\gamma$. Earlier, G$\alpha$GTP was recognized as the primary signal transducer of the pathway and G$\beta$$\gamma$ as a passive signaling modality that facilitates the activity of G$\alpha$. However, G$\beta$$\gamma$ later found to regulate more number of pathways than G$\alpha$GTP does. Once liberated from the heterotrimer, free G$\beta$$\gamma$ interacts and activates a diverse range of signaling regulators including kinases, lipases, GTPases, and ion channels, and it does not require any posttranslation modifications. G$\beta$$\gamma$ family consists of 48 members, which show cell- and tissue-specific expressions, and recent reports show that cells employ the subtype diversity in G$\beta$$\gamma$ to achieve desired signaling outcomes. In addition to activated GPCRs, which induce free G$\beta$$\gamma$ generation and the rate of GTP hydrolysis in G$\alpha$, which sequester G$\beta$$\gamma$ in the heterotrimer, terminating G$\beta$$\gamma$ signaling, additional regulatory mechanisms exist to regulate G$\beta$$\gamma$ activity. In this chapter, we discuss structure and function, subtype diversity and its significance in signaling regulation, effector activation, regulatory mechanisms as well as the disease relevance of G$\beta$$\gamma$ in eukaryotes.},

The transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-dependent signalling pathways upon stimulation of G- protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are critical for the mitogenic activity of ligands such as lysophosphatidic acid, endothelin, thrombin, bombesin and carbachol, provides evidence for such an interconnected communication network. Here we show that EGFR transactivation upon GPCR stimulation involves proHB-EGF and a metalloproteinase activity that is rapidly induced upon GPCR-ligand interaction. We show that inhibition of proHB-EGF processing blocks GPCR-induced EGFR transactivation and downstream signals. The pathophysiological significance of this mechanism is demonstrated by inhibition of constitutive EGFR activity upon treatment of PC3 prostate carcinoma cells with the metalloproteinase inhibitor batimastat. Together, our results establish a new mechanistic concept for cross- communication among different signalling systems.},

Their huge potential in making new findings is yet to be unlocked by making them available for large-scale analysis. In order to do so it is essential that independent studies designed for similar biological problems can be integrated, so that new insights can be obtained. These insights would remain undiscovered when analyzing the individual data sets because it is well known that the small number of biological samples used per experiment is a bottleneck in genomic analysis. By increasing the number of samples the statistical power is increased and more general and reliable conclusions can be drawn. In this work, two different approaches for conducting large-scale analysis of microarray gene expression data—meta-analysis and data merging—are compared in the context of the identification of cancer-related biomarkers, by analyzing six independent lung cancer studies. Within this study, we investigate the hypothesis that analyzing large cohorts of samples resulting in merging independent data sets designed to study the same biological problem results in lower false discovery rates than analyzing the same data sets within a more conservative meta-analysis approach.},

Recently, several human rhomboid genes have been associated with the development of chronic myeloid leukemia and pituitary, colorectal, ovarian, and breast cancers. In this study, we evaluated the mRNA and protein expression profiles of rhomboid genes in cancer cell lines and breast tissue/tumor samples. In silico analysis of publicly available gene expression datasets showed that different rhomboid genes are specifically expressed according to the breast cancer intrinsic subtypes. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed a significant RHBDD2 mRNA overexpression in advanced breast cancer compared with normal tissue samples (p=0.012). In addition, we found that RHBDL2 and PARL mRNA expression was associated with a low/intermediate histologic tumor grade (p=0.024 and p=0.015, respectively). Immunohistochemistry analysis showed a significant increase of RHBDD2 protein expression in association with breast cancer samples negative for progesterone receptor (p=0.015). Moreover, protein expression analysis corroborated the quantitative RT-PCR results, indicating that breast primary tumors belonging to patients with a more disseminated disease expressed significantly increased levels of RHBDD2 protein compared with less disseminated tumors (p=0.01). {\textcopyright} International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM) 2013.},

Rhomboids typically contain six or seven transmembrane domains (TMD) and have been classified into four subgroups: Secretase A and B, Presenilin-Associated- Rhomboid-Like (PARL) and iRhoms. Although the iRhoms, iRhom1 and iRhom2, have lost their protease activity during evolution, they retain key non-protease functions and have been implicated in the regulation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) signalling. EGF is moreover a substrate of RHBDL2, their active Rhomboid relative. Other substrates of RHBDL2 include members of the EphrinB family and thrombomodulin. RHBDL2 has also previously been demonstrated to be important in wound healing in cutaneous keratinocytes through the cleavage of thrombomodulin. Additional roles for these intriguing proteins seem likely to be revealed in the future.

ADAM17, a membrane-tethered metalloprotease, is the primary shedding enzyme responsible for the release of the inflammatory cytokine TNF$\alpha$ and several EGF receptor ligands. ADAM17 exists in complex with the rhomboid-like iRhom proteins, which act as cofactors that regulate ADAM17 substrate shedding. Here we report that the poorly characterised FERM domain-containing protein FRMD8 is a new component of the iRhom2/ADAM17 sheddase complex. FRMD8 binds to the cytoplasmic N-terminus of iRhoms and is necessary to stabilise iRhoms and ADAM17 at the cell surface. In the absence of FRMD8, iRhom2 and ADAM17 are degraded via the endolysosomal pathway, resulting in the reduction of ADAM17-mediated shedding. We have confirmed the pathophysiological significance of FRMD8 in iPSC-derived human macrophages and mouse tissues, thus demonstrating its role in the regulated release of multiple cytokine and growth factor signals.</p>},

However, differential usage of gene transcripts between conditions (isoform switching) has not been comprehensively characterized in and across cancer types. To this end, we developed methods for identification and visualization of isoform switches with predicted functional consequences. Using these methods, we characterized isoform switching in RNA-seq data from >5,500 cancer patients covering 12 solid cancer types. Isoform switches with potential functional consequences were common, affecting approximately 19\% of multiple transcript genes. Among these, isoform switches leading to loss of DNA sequence encoding protein domains were more frequent than expected, particularly in pancancer switches. We identified several isoform switches as powerful biomarkers: 31 switches were highly predictive of patient survival independent of cancer types. Our data constitute an important resource for cancer researchers, available through interactive web tools. Moreover, our methods, available as an R package, enable systematic analysis of isoform switches from other RNA-seq datasets. Implications: This study indicates that isoform switches with predicted functional consequences are common and important in dysfunctional cells, which in turn means that gene expression should be analyzed at the isoform level.},

abstract = {Cancer is clearly the most deadly disease in the developed world as one in three people develop cancer during their lifetime. The cure for cancer is like the Holy Grail since most of the existing treatments are not effective enough to provide full protection from this disease. In recent years the burgeoning of sophisticated genomic, proteomic and bioinformatics techniques has made it possible for us to get a glimpse of the intricate interplay of numerous cellular genes and regulatory genetic elements that are responsible for the manifestation of cancerous phenotypes. With the use of modern genomic technologies we are now beginning to understand the enormous complexity of cancer. However there are few success stories as far as the treatment of cancer is concerned. For instance the treatments of leukemia and lymphoma have been established and proved to be satisfactory. Despite occasional successes the treatment for most cancers is still a long way from reality. In this editorial, we have addressed several reasons for the difficulties in cancer treatment.},

HISAT (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of transcripts), StringTie and Ballgown are free, open-source software tools for comprehensive analysis of RNA-seq experiments. Together, they allow scientists to align reads to a genome, assemble transcripts including novel splice variants, compute the abundance of these transcripts in each sample and compare experiments to identify differentially expressed genes and transcripts. This protocol describes all the steps necessary to process a large set of raw sequencing reads and create lists of gene transcripts, expression levels, and differentially expressed genes and transcripts. The protocol's execution time depends on the computing resources, but it typically takes under 45 min of computer time.},

The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common.

   abstract = {Background: RNA-seq is revolutionizing the way we study transcriptomes. mRNA can be surveyed without prior knowledge of gene transcripts. Alternative splicing of transcript isoforms and the identification of previously unknown exons are being reported. Initial reports of differences in exon usage, and splicing between samples as well as quantitative differences among samples are beginning to surface. Biological variation has been reported to be larger than technical variation. In addition, technical variation has been reported to be in line with expectations due to random sampling. However, strategies for dealing with technical variation will differ depending on the magnitude. The size of technical variance, and the role of sampling are examined in this manuscript.Results: In this study three independent Solexa/Illumina experiments containing technical replicates are analyzed. When coverage is low, large disagreements between technical replicates are apparent. Exon detection between technical replicates is highly variable when the coverage is less than 5 reads per nucleotide and estimates of gene expression are more likely to disagree when coverage is low. Although large disagreements in the estimates of expression are observed at all levels of coverage.Conclusions: Technical variability is too high to ignore. Technical variability results in inconsistent detection of exons at low levels of coverage. Further, the estimate of the relative abundance of a transcript can substantially disagree, even when coverage levels are high. This may be due to the low sampling fraction and if so, it will persist as an issue needing to be addressed in experimental design even as the next wave of technology produces larger numbers of reads. We provide practical recommendations for dealing with the technical variability, without dramatic cost increases.2011 McIntyre et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Background: A generally accepted approach to the analysis of RNA-Seq read count data does not yet exist. We sequenced the mRNA of 726 individuals from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel in order to quantify differences in gene expression among single flies. One of our experimental goals was to identify the optimal analysis approach for the detection of differential gene expression among the factors we varied in the experiment: genotype, environment, sex, and their interactions. Here we evaluate three different filtering strategies, eight normalization methods, and two statistical approaches using our data set. We assessed differential gene expression among factors and performed a statistical power analysis using the eight biological replicates per genotype, environment, and sex in our data set. Results: We found that the most critical considerations for the analysis of RNA-Seq read count data were the normalization method, underlying data distribution assumption, and numbers of biological replicates, an observation consistent with previous RNA-Seq and microarray analysis comparisons. Some common normalization methods, such as Total Count, Quantile, and RPKM normalization, did not align the data across samples. Furthermore, analyses using the Median, Quantile, and Trimmed Mean of M-values normalization methods were sensitive to the removal of low-expressed genes from the data set. Although it is robust in many types of analysis, the normal data distribution assumption produced results vastly different than the negative binomial distribution. In addition, at least three biological replicates per condition were required in order to have sufficient statistical power to detect expression differences among the three-way interaction of genotype, environment, and sex. Conclusions: The best analysis approach to our data was to normalize the read counts using the DESeq method and apply a generalized linear model assuming a negative binomial distribution using either edgeR or DESeq software. Genes having very low read counts were removed after normalizing the data and fitting it to the negative binomial distribution. We describe the results of this evaluation and include recommended analysis strategies for RNA-Seq read count data.},

   abstract = {Most human invasive breast cancers (IBCs) appear to develop over long periods of time from certain pre-existing benign lesions. Of the many types of benign lesions in the human breast, only a few appear to have significant premalignant potential. The best characterized of these include atypical hyperplasias and in situ carcinomas and both categories are probably well on along the evolutionary pathway to IBC. Very little is known about earlier premalignant alterations. All types of premalignant breast lesions are relatively common but only a small proportion appear to progress to IBC. They are currently defined by their histological features and their prognosis is imprecisely estimated from indirect epidemiological evidence. Although lesions within specific categories look alike, they must possess underlying biological differences causing some to remain stable and others to progress. Recent studies suggest that they evolve by highly diverse genetic mechanisms and research into these altered pathways may identify specific early defects that can be targeted to prevent premalignant lesions from developing or becoming cancerous. It is far more rational to think that breast cancer can be prevented than cured once it has developed fully. This review discusses histological models of human premalignant breast disease that provide the framework for scientific investigations into the biological alterations behind them and examples of specific biological alterations that appear to be particularly important.},

Advanced breast cancer with distant organ metastases is considered incurable with currently available therapies. On the molecular level, breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease; molecular features include activation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, encoded by ERBB2), activation of hormone receptors (oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) and/or BRCA mutations. Treatment strategies differ according to molecular subtype. Management of breast cancer is multidisciplinary; it includes locoregional (surgery and radiation therapy) and systemic therapy approaches. Systemic therapies include endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive disease, chemotherapy, anti-HER2 therapy for HER2-positive disease, bone stabilizing agents, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for BRCA mutation carriers and, quite recently, immunotherapy. Future therapeutic concepts in breast cancer aim at individualization of therapy as well as at treatment de-escalation and escalation based on tumour biology and early therapy response. Next to further treatment innovations, equal worldwide access to therapeutic advances remains the global challenge in breast cancer care for the future.},

   abstract = {Comparative analyses of ESTs and cDNAs with genomic DNA predict a high frequency of alternative splicing in human genes. However, there is an ongoing debate as to how many of these predicted splice variants are functional and how many are the result of aberrant splicing (or 'noise'). To address this question, we compared alternatively spliced cassette exons that are conserved between human and mouse with EST-predicted cassette exons that are not conserved in the mouse genome. Presumably, conserved exon-skipping events represent functional alternative splicing. We show that conserved (functional) cassette exons possess unique characteristics in size, repeat content and in their influence on the protein. By contrast, most non-conserved cassette exons do not share these characteristics. We conclude that a significant portion of cassette exons evident in EST databases is not functional, and might result from aberrant rather than regulated splicing.},

   abstract = {Background: The majority of mammalian genes generate multiple transcript variants and protein isoforms through alternative transcription and/or alternative splicing, and the dynamic changes at the transcript/isoform level between non-oncogenic and cancer cells remain largely unexplored. We hypothesized that isoform level expression profiles would be better than gene level expression profiles at discriminating between non-oncogenic and cancer cellsgene level.Methods: We analyzed 160 Affymetrix exon-array datasets, comprising cell lines of non-oncogenic or oncogenic tissue origins. We obtained the transcript-level and gene level expression estimates, and used unsupervised and supervised clustering algorithms to study the profile similarity between the samples at both gene and isoform levels.Results: Hierarchical clustering, based on isoform level expressions, effectively grouped the non-oncogenic and oncogenic cell lines with a virtually perfect homogeneity-grouping rate (97.5\%), regardless of the tissue origin of the cell lines. However, gene levelthis rate was much lower, being 75\% at best based on the gene level expressions. Statistical analyses of the difference between cancer and non-oncogenic samples identified the existence of numerous genes with differentially expressed isoforms, which otherwise were not significant at the gene level. We also found that canonical pathways of protein ubiquitination, purine metabolism, and breast-cancer regulation by stathmin1 were significantly enriched among genes that show differential expression at isoform level but not at gene level.Conclusions: In summary, cancer cell lines, regardless of their tissue of origin, can be effectively discriminated from non-cancer cell lines at isoform level, but not at gene level. This study suggests the existence of an isoform signature, rather than a gene signature, which could be used to distinguish cancer cells from normal cells. 2013 Zhang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

We have previously localized the TOC locus to a small genomic interval within chromosomal region 17q25. Using a targeted capture array and next-generation sequencing, we have now identified missense mutations $(c.557T>C [p.Ile186Thr] and c.566C>T [p.Pro189Leu]$ in RHBDF2, which encodes the inactive rhomboid protease RHBDF2 (also known as iRhom2), as the underlying cause of TOC. We show that the distribution of RHBDF2 in tylotic skin is altered in comparison with that in normal skin, and immortalized tylotic keratinocytes have decreased levels of total epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and display an increased proliferative and migratory potential relative to normal cells, even when normal cells are stimulated with exogenous epidermal growth factor. It would thus appear that EGFR signaling is dysregulated in tylotic cells. Furthermore, we also show an altered localization of RHBDF2 in both tylotic and sporadic squamous esophageal tumors. The elucidation of a role of RHBDF2 in growth-factor signaling in esophageal cancer will help to determine whether targeting this pathway in chemotherapy for this and other squamous cell carcinomas will be effective. © 2012 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

Dominant iRHOM2 mutations are the cause of the inherited cutaneous and oesophageal cancer-susceptibility syndrome tylosis with oesophageal cancer (TOC), suggesting a role for this protein in epithelial cells. Here, using tissues derived from TOC patients, we demonstrate that TOC-associated mutations in iRHOM2 cause an increase in the maturation and activity of ADAM17 in epidermal keratinocytes, resulting in significantly upregulated shedding of ADAM17 substrates, including EGF-family growth factors and proinflammatory cytokines. This activity is accompanied by increased EGFR activity, increased desmosome processing and the presence of immature epidermal desmosomes, upregulated epidermal transglutaminase activity and heightened resistance to Staphylococcal infection in TOC keratinocytes. Many of these features are consistent with the presence of a constitutive wound-healing-like phenotype in TOC epidermis, which may shed light on a novel pathway in skin repair, regeneration and inflammation. © The Author 2014.

In mammals iRhoms are known to regulate the trafficking of TACE, the protease that cleaves the membrane bound inflammatory cytokine TNF. We have mapped a spontaneously occurring mouse mutation with a loss of hair phenotype, curly bare (cub), to the Rhbdf2 locus, which encodes the iRhom2 protein. The cub deletion removes the first 268 amino acids of the iRhom2 protein but is not a loss of function. We have also identified a previously reported suppressor of cub, called Mcub (modifier of curly bare), and find it to be a loss of function allele of the amphiregulin gene (Areg). Amphiregulin is an activating ligand of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that, like TNF, is released by TACE. Our results therefore imply a regulatory link between iRhoms and EGFR signalling in mammals. We have tested the model that the cub mutation leads to iRhom2 hyperactivity and consequently excess TACE processing of amphiregulin and elevated EGFR signalling. Our results do not support this hypothesis: we find that, compared to wild-type cells, cub mutant embryonic fibroblasts release less amphiregulin, and that the cub mutant form of iRhom2 is less able than wild type to bind to TACE and promote its maturation.},

   abstract = {The metalloproteinase ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17) controls EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling by liberating EGFR ligands from their membrane anchor. Consequently, a patient lacking ADAM17 has skin and intestinal barrier defects that are likely caused by lack of EGFR signaling, and Adam17 mice die perinatally with open eyes, like Egfr mice. A hallmark feature of ADAM17-dependent EGFR ligand shedding is that it can be rapidly and posttranslationally activated in a manner that requires its transmembrane domain but not its cytoplasmic domain. This suggests that ADAM17 is regulated by other integral membrane proteins, although much remains to be learned about the underlying mechanism. Recently, inactive Rhomboid 2 (iRhom2), which has seven transmembrane domains, emerged as a molecule that controls the maturation and function of ADAM17 in myeloid cells. However, iRhom2 mice appear normal, raising questions about how ADAM17 is regulated in other tissues. Here we report that iRhom1/2 double knockout mice resemble Adam17 and Egfr mice in that they die perinatally with open eyes, misshapen heart valves, and growth plate defects. Mechanistically, we show lack of mature ADAM17 and strongly reduced EGFR phosphorylation in iRhom1/2 tissues. Finally, we demonstrate that iRhom1 is not essential for mouse development but regulates ADAM17 maturation in the brain, except in microglia, where ADAM17 is controlled by iRhom2. These results provide genetic, cell biological, and biochemical evidence that a principal function of iRhoms1/2 during mouse development is to regulate ADAM17-dependent EGFR signaling, suggesting that iRhoms1/2 could emerge as novel targets for treatment of ADAM17/EGFR-dependent pathologies.},

However, little is known about the physiological substrates for iRhom2 or the molecular mechanisms underlying these functions. We show that iRhom2 is a short-lived protein whose stability can be increased by select mutations in the N-terminal domain. In turn, these stable variants function to augment the secretion of EGF family ligands, including amphiregulin, independent of metallo-protease a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) activity. In vivo, N-terminal iRhom2 mutations induce accelerated wound healing as well as accelerated tumorigenesis, but they do not drive spontaneous tumor development. This work underscores the physiological prominence of iRhom2 in controlling EGFR signaling events involved in wound healing and neoplastic growth, and yields insight into the function of key iRhom2 domains.},

AREG, synthesized as a propeptide, requires conversion to an active peptide by metalloproteases by a process known as ectodomain shedding. Although (ADAM17) a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 is a key sheddase of AREG, ADAM8, ADAM15, and batimastat (broad metalloprotease inhibitor)-sensitive metalloproteases have also been implicated in AREG shedding. In the present study, using a curly bare (Rhbdf2 cub) mouse model that shows loss-of-hair, enlarged sebaceous gland, and rapid cutaneous wound-healing phenotypes mediated by enhanced Areg mRNA and protein levels, we sought to identify the principal ectodomain sheddase of AREG. To this end, we generated Rhbdf2cub mice lacking ADAM17 specifically in the skin and examined the above phenotypes of Rhbdf2cub mice. We find that ADAM17 deficiency in the skin of Rhbdf2cub mice restores a full hair coat, prevents sebaceous gland enlargement, and impairs the rapid wound-healing phenotype observed in Rhbdf2 cub mice. Furthermore, in vitro, stimulated shedding of AREG is abolished in Rhbdf2 cub mouse embryonic keratinocytes lacking ADAM17. Thus, our data support previous findings demonstrating that ADAM17 is the major ectodomain sheddase of AREG.},

Here we show that the physiological role of iRhoms is much broader. iRhom1 knockout mice die within 6 weeks of birth. They show a severe phenotype, with defects in several tissues including highly penetrant brain haemorrhages. The non-overlapping phenotypes imply that iRhom 1 and 2 have distinct physiological roles, although at a cellular level both promote the maturation of TACE (but not other ADAM proteases). Both iRhoms are co-expressed in many contexts where TACE acts.

This led to the discovery of the wider rhomboid superfamily, a clan that in metazoans is dominated by pseudoproteases. These so-called rhomboid pseudoproteases inherited from their catalytically active ancestors a conserved rhomboid-like domain and a propensity to regulate signaling. Lacking catalytic activity, they developed new ‘pseudoenzyme’ functions that include regulating the trafficking, turnover, and activity of their client proteins. Rhomboid pseudoproteases have preeminent roles in orchestrating immune cell activation, antiviral responses, and cytokine release in response to microbial infection, or in chronic diseases, and have also been implicated in growth factor signaling, cancer, and, more recently, metabolism. Here, we discuss the mechanism(s) of action of rhomboid pseudoproteases, contrasted with rhomboid proteases.

   abstract = {Background: The renal tubules, which have distant metabolic features and functions in different segments, reabsorb >99\% of approximately 180 l of water and 25,000 mmol of Na + daily. Defective metabolism in renal tubules is involved in the pathobiology of kidney diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying the metabolic regulation in renal tubules remain to be defined. Methods: We quantitatively compared the proteomes of the isolated proximal tubules (PT) and distal tubules (DT) from C57BL/6 mouse using tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling-based quantitative mass spectrometry. Bioinformatics analysis of the differentially expressed proteins revealed the significant differences between PT and DT in metabolism pathway. We also performed in vitro and in vivo assays to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the distant metabolic features in PT and DT. Findings: We demonstrate that the renal proximal tubule (PT) has high expression of lipid metabolism enzymes, which is transcriptionally upregulated by abundantly expressed PPAR $\alpha$/ , $\gamma$. In contrast, the renal distal tubule (DT) has elevated glycolytic enzyme expression, which is mediated by highly expressed c-Myc. Importantly, PPAR$\gamma$ transcriptionally enhances the protease iRhom2 expression in PT, which suppresses EGF expression and secretion and subsequent EGFR-dependent glycolytic gene expression and glycolysis. PPAR$\gamma$ inhibition reduces iRhom2 expression and increases EGF and GLUT1 expression in PT in mice, resulting in renal tubule hypertrophy, tubulointerstitial fibrosis and damaged kidney functions, which are rescued by 2-deoxy-D-glucose treatment. Interpretation: These findings delineate instrumental mechanisms underlying the active lipid metabolism and suppressed glycolysis in PT and active glycolysis in DT and reveal critical roles for PPARs and c-Myc in maintaining renal metabolic homeostasis.

Given the well-known metabolic alterations in cancer development, we will focus specifically in the 19 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which can be selectively activated by metabolites. These metabolite sensing GPCRs control crucial processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival after their activation. In the present review, we will describe the main functions of these metabolite sensing GPCRs and shed light on the benefits of their potential use as possible pharmacological targets for cancer treatment.},

   abstract = {Proteolytic cleavage and release from the cell surface of membrane-tethered ligands is an important mechanism of regulating intercellular signalling. TACE is a major shedding protease, responsible for the liberation of the inflammatory cytokine TNF$\alpha$ and ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor. iRhoms, catalytically inactive members of the rhomboid-like superfamily, have been shown to control the ER-to-Golgi transport and maturation of TACE. Here, we reveal that iRhom2 remains associated with TACE throughout the secretory pathway, and is stabilised at the cell surface by this interaction. At the plasma membrane, ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation and 14-3-3 protein binding of the cytoplasmic amino-terminus of iRhom2 alter its interaction with mature TACE, thereby licensing its proteolytic activity. We show that this molecular mechanism is responsible for triggering inflammatory responses in primary mouse macrophages. Overall, iRhom2 binds to TACE throughout its lifecycle, implying that iRhom2 is a primary regulator of stimulated cytokine and growth factor signalling.},

It has been well documented that the transactivation of the EGFR plays critical roles for many cellular functions, such as proliferation and migration mediated through multiple G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Recent accumulating evidence has suggested that ADAMs are the key metalloproteases activated by several GPCR agonists to produce a mature EGFR ligand leading to the EGFR transactivation. In this review, we describe the current knowledge on ADAMs implicated in mediating EGFR transactivation. The major focus of the review will be on the possible upstream mechanisms of ADAM activation by GPCRs as well as downstream signal transduction and the pathophysiological significances of ADAM-dependent EGFR transactivation.

   abstract = {Activation of nuclear factor (NF)-$\kappa$B, one of the most investigated transcription factors, has been found to control multiple cellular processes in cancer including inflammation, transformation, proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis, chemoresistance and radioresistance. NF-$\kappa$B is constitutively active in most tumor cells, and its suppression inhibits the growth of tumor cells, leading to the concept of NF-$\kappa$B addiction in cancer cells. Why NF-$\kappa$B is constitutively and persistently active in cancer cells is not fully understood, but multiple mechanisms have been delineated including agents that activate NF-$\kappa$B (such as viruses, viral proteins, bacteria and cytokines), signaling intermediates (such as mutant receptors, overexpression of kinases, mutant oncoproteins, degradation of IB$\alpha$, histone deacetylase, overexpression of transglutaminase and iNOS) and cross talk between NF-$\kappa$B and other transcription factors (such as STAT3, HIF-1$\alpha$, AP1, SP, p53, PPAR$\gamma$, Β-catenin, AR, GR and ER). As NF-$\kappa$B is pre-active in cancer cells through unrelated mechanisms, classic inhibitors of NF-$\kappa$B (for example, bortezomib) are unlikely to mediate their anticancer effects through suppression of NF-$\kappa$B. This review discusses multiple mechanisms of NF-$\kappa$B activation and their regulation by multitargeted agents in contrast to monotargeted agents, thus one size does not fit all cancers. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

On the contrary to the canonical NF-$\kappa$B pathway, the effect of the noncanonical NF-$\kappa$B pathway in BCa progression remains elusive. Methods: BCa tumor tissues and the corresponding cell lines were examined to determine the correlation between RelB and the aggressiveness of BCa. RelB was manipulated in BCa cells to examine whether RelB promotes cell proliferation and motility by quantitation of apoptosis, cell cycle, migration, and invasion. RNA-Seq was performed to identify the critical RelB-regulated genes involved in BCa metastasis. Particularly, RelB-regulated MMP1 transcription was verified using luciferase reporter and ChIP assay. Subsequently, the effect of RelB on BCa progression was further validated using BCa mice xenograft models. Results: RelB uniquely expresses at a high level in aggressive BCa tissues, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). RelB promotes BCa cell proliferation through increasing G1/S transition and/or decreasing apoptosis by upregulation of Cyclin D1 and Bcl-2. Additionally, RelB enhances cell mobility by activating EMT. Importantly, RelB upregulates bone metastatic protein MMP1 expression through binding to an NF-$\kappa$B enhancer element located at the 5′-flanking region. Accordingly, in vivo functional validation confirmed that RelB deficiency impairs tumor growth in nude mice and inhibits lung metastasis in SCID mice.},

   abstract = {R-Ras, a member of the Ras superfamily, is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and regulates cell adhesion, migration, differentiation and apoptosis. Research has raised the possibility that R-Ras may function as a positive regulator of cell proliferation and transformation in the breast. To understand the possible role of R-Ras in breast epithelial carcinogenesis, the expression and activation of R-Ras were detected in each of 69 pairs of breast cancer tissues and normal tumor-adjacent tissue samples by qRT-PCR, western blot analysis and GST pull down assay; 12 available cell lines were also subjected to western blot analysis and GST pull down assay. To further address the role of R-Ras in transformation-related phenotype formation of breast cancer cell line MCF-7 in vitro, R-Ras38V, a constitutively activated mutant of R-Ras, was transfected into MCF-7 cells, and the cell proliferation, migration and cell cycle distribution were analyzed. The results showed that although there was slight difference in the protein expression of R-Ras between the breast cancer tissues and normal tissues, the activation of R-Ras was reduced in 63.8\% of the cancer tissues when compared to the normal tissue samples. In addition, the results also showed that R-Ras38V inhibited cell proliferation, migration and cell cycle progression in the presence of serum. Contradicting the positive association reported in previous studies, our results indicate that R-Ras activation may negatively regulate the transformation of breast epithelial cells, and the loss of activation of R-Ras may be involved in the carcinogenesis of breast cancer. To solve this controversy, further independent studies are needed to validate our study results.},

   abstract = {Background: Recent studies on the involvement of the G12 family of heterotrimeric G proteins (G$\alpha$12 and G$\alpha$13, the products of the GNA12 and GNA13 genes, respectively) in oncogenic pathways have uncovered a link between G12 signaling and cancer progression. However, despite a well characterized role of Rho GTPases, the potential role of secreted factors in the capacity of G12 signaling to promote invasion of cancer cells is just beginning to be addressed.Methods: MDA-MB-231 and MCF10A breast cancer cell lines were employed as a model system to explore the involvement of secreted factors in G12-stimulated cell invasion. Factors secreted by cells expressing dominant-active G$\alpha$12 were identified by protein array, and their involvement in breast cancer cell invasion was assessed through both RNAi-mediated knockdown and antibody neutralization approaches. Bioinformatics analysis of the promoter elements of the identified factors suggested NF-$\kappa$B elements played a role in their enhanced expression, which was tested by chromatin immunoprecipitation.Results: We found that signaling through the G$\alpha$12 in MDA-MB-231 and MCF10A breast cancer cell lines enhances expression of interleukins (IL)-6 and -8, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and that these secreted factors play a role in G12-stimulated cell invasion. Furthermore, the enhanced expression of these secreted factors was found to be facilitated by the activation of their corresponding promoters, where NF-$\kappa$B seems to be one of the major regulators. Inhibition of IL-6 and IL-8, or MMP-2 activity significantly decreased G$\alpha$12-mediated cell invasion.Conclusions: These studies confirm and extend findings that secreted factors contribute to the oncogenic potential of G12 signaling, and suggest potential therapeutic targets to control this process. © 2014 Chia et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Targeting HER2 with antibodies or small molecule inhibitors in HER2-positive breast cancer leads to improved survival, but resistance is a common clinical problem. To uncover novel mechanisms of resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in breast cancer, we performed a kinase open reading frame screen to identify genes that rescue HER2-amplified breast cancer cells from HER2 inhibition or suppression. In addition to multiple members of the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) signaling pathways, we discovered that expression of the survival kinases PRKACA and PIM1 rescued cells from anti-HER2 therapy. Furthermore, we observed elevated PRKACA expression in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer samples, indicating that this pathway is activated in breast cancers that are clinically resistant to trastuzumab-containing therapy. We found that neither PRKACA nor PIM1 restored MAPK or PI3K activation after lapatinib or trastuzumab treatment, but rather inactivated the pro-apoptotic protein BAD, the BCl-2-associated death promoter, thereby permitting survival signaling through BCL-XL. Pharmacological blockade of BCL-XL/BCL-2 partially abrogated the rescue effects conferred by PRKACA and PIM1, and sensitized cells to lapatinib treatment. These observations suggest that combined targeting of HER2 and the BCL-XL/BCL-2 anti-apoptotic pathway may increase responses to anti-HER2 therapy in breast cancer and decrease the emergence of resistant disease.},

abstract = {Background: breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death for women worldwide. In the past two decades, published epidemiological reports in different parts of the world show significant increase in breast cancer mortality rate. The aim of this study was to determine the 25-year trend of breast cancer mortality rate in 7 super regions defined by the Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), i.e. Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia and Oceania, Latin America and Caribbean, Central Europe and Eastern Europe and Central Asia, High-income. Methods: Our study population consisted of 195 world countries in the IHME pre-defined seven super regions. The age-standardized mortality rates from 1990 to 2015 were extracted from the IHME site. The reference life table for calculating mortality rates was constructed based on the lowest estimated age-specific mortality rates from all locations with populations over 5 million in the 2015 iteration of GBD. To determine the trend of breast cancer mortality rate, a generalized linear mixed model was fitted separately for each IHME region and super region. Results: Statistical analysis showed a significant increase for breast cancer mortality rate in all super regions, except for High-income super region. For total world countries, the mean breast cancer mortality rate was 13.77 per 100,000 in 1990 and the overall slope of mortality rate was 0.7 per 100,000 from 1990 to 2015. The results showed that Latin America and Caribbean the highest increasing trend of breast cancer mortality rate during the years 1990 to 2015 (1.48 per 100,000). Conclusion: In general, our finding showed a significant increase in breast cancer mortality rate in the world during the past 25 years, which could be due to increase in incidence and prevalence of this cancer. Low this increasing trend is an alarm for health policy makers in all countries, especially in developing countries and low-income regions which experienced sharp slopes of breast cancer mortality rate.},

	abstract = {Neuromedin U (NMU) is a potent regulator of food intake and activity in mammals. While some downstream targets of NMU have been localized, connectivity of the neural circuits employing this neuropeptide is largely unknown. In Drosophila, neurons producing the homologous neuropeptide hugin regulate feeding and locomotion in a similar manner and project to structures of the central nervous system analogous to those in which NMU is found. Here, we use EM reconstruction and receptor expression analysis to map the connectome of hugin-producing neurons in the Drosophila larval central nervous system. We show that hugin-producing neurons establish distinct units that are reciprocally connected and share connectivity motifs. One of these units employs fast synaptic transmission as well as neuromodulation to target neuroendocrine cells (NSCs) of the pars intercerebralis, the Drosophila homolog of the hypothalamus. These NSCs produce CRH- and insulin-like peptides, which are homologs of downstream targets of NMU. Furthermore, most of the hugin-producing neurons, including those that target the NSCs, receive inputs from chemosensory neurons in the subesophageal zone, the brain stem analog in Drosophila. Our data positions hugin neurons as part of a novel sensory-to-endocrine network that reflects the way NMU operates in mammals. We propose that the hugin neurons interconnecting chemosensory and neuroendocrine organs are part of a physiological control system that has been conserved not only at functional and molecular levels, but at the network architecture level as well.},
